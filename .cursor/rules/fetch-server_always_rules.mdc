# Global Project Rules
1. You must write code following clean code principles.
2. You must follow SOLID principles during development.
3. Before creating a new file or writing a method, check if similar code already exists.
4. Do not delete files directly. Make sure to get approval from a developer and proceed in a suggestive manner. Directly deleting files yourself can damage the architecture.
5. Do not write unnecessary comments. After writing code, explain the changes via chat if needed.
6. Communication should follow RESTful principles. Please ensure that URLs, URIs, and methods are constructed in accordance with RESTful conventions.
