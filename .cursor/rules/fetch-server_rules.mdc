## Error and Exception Handling
1. Error and exception handling should be performed at the controller level. At the service or repository level, exceptions should be thrown using `throw`.
2. Errors and exceptions should be managed globally. Manage them in the global section to ensure consistent handling.
3. When an error or exception occurs, make sure the log records the name of the method where it occurred.
4. Log only when an exception or error occurs.
5. Manage API documentation using Swagger. For POST requests, provide example values in the DTOs for Swagger documentation.
